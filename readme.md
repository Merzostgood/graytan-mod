## Mod functions
- Unlimited number of points / places
- Setting up binds for each point
- Auto 2FA added (for Mirror Pylon v4 and above)

## Small documentation of the mod
1. The mod has its own commands /gtp, /graytan, /gteleport, /graytantp (you can use any of these "prefixes").
2. Subcommands:
- tp "name"
- list (Lists all points)
3. The "Time left to turn completion" setting is responsible for the time that will pass between the change of direction and the 2FA change of direction. It is specified in milliseconds. If you need to disable this function, then specify -1
4. The "Name" setting is responsible for the name of the point that is used in the /gtp tp command. You can only use [a-Z], [0-9], [ _ - ]. The point will always be automatically named after saving the config.

## Dependencies mod
1. Fabric api
2. Cloth config (>=17.0.142)
3. Mod menu (Needed to configure the mod)
